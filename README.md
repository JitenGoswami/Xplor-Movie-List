# Xplor-Movie-List


**Project information:**
Architecture of this project is in MVVM with Swift and SwiftUI. Testing is done in iOS 14.3 with iPhone 12 pro max simulator.

**Pod:**
I have used pod for using third party libraries.
At present only one third part library is used which is Kingfisher for download images using url.

**Pod error solution:**
If pod gives an error. Kindly open terminal and reach to project folder than enter pod install.

**Limitations:**
As this is developed in older SwiftUI version. I need to create own search component to search movies couldn’t use searchable.
